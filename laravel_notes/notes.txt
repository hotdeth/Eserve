                                                                         ***this notes for laravel work***
-Please don't modify any file or any folder in laravel except {/resourses/views,/routes/web.php}
-If you need to add page you should write .blade.php as extension for all (html,php,css)
-If you need to make route just goto routes/web.php and put the new route same of the orignal home route you will see
-Make your work easy on each other by typing notes and updates of the web
-this is the hard part of our project we need to make it so static and avoid prolems 

examples:
    if you create home file in views like -> home.blade.php and want this page to appear when user open the website 
      you need to create a route for this and to do this write:


          `Route::get('/', function (){
                  return view('home')

            });`
if you make  a subsite like dhcp.blade.php you need to make route for it:
          `Route::get('/dhcp', function (){
                  return view('dhcp')

            });`
and all pages will be the same
